* Git updating
  * Check for changes and schedule builds
  * Check for new branches and create new projects
* Projects need to be configurable to branches (currently default to master)
* A command line "fudge server" to start the server

***
* A "Fudgefile" to specify what to do for individual builds
* A "fudge build bla" command which will read the Fudgefile and work out what to do (depending on branch)
***

* Auto creation of project directory when running fudge server (or perhaps "fudge init in a project")
* Ability to mount fudge app on any Rack web server, rather than through fudge server (for production)
